# 📊 A/B Testing Project – Conversion Rate Analysis

This project applies A/B testing to evaluate whether a new version of a webpage leads to higher user conversion rates compared to the existing version.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

For this project, we analyzed the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company launched a new version of their landing page with the goal of increasing the number of users who "convert" — meaning users who choose to pay for the product.

The task is to assess the test results and help the company decide:
- Should they **implement the new page**?
- Should they **keep the old page**?
- Or should they **run the experiment longer**?

## 🧪 Objective

To determine whether the **new page (treatment)** results in a statistically significant improvement in conversion rate compared to the **current page (control)**.
